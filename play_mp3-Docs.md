The ```Play_mp3``` module can be useful to play mp3 sounds or musics very easily..
To play any mp3 sound the syntax would be:-

```
import Play_mp3
Play_mp3.play(<file name here>)
```

And to install the module you have to open powershell or command prompt on windows or terminal on linux or MacOS and then type 
```
python -m pip install play_mp3
```
And make sure that the first letter ```p``` should be small while installing it but ```P``` should be capital while importing it
